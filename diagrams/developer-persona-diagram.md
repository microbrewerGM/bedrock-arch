## Key Insights for Solution Design

### Developer Perspective
- The solution must be seamlessly integrated into VS Code, their primary IDE
- Authentication should be transparent, leveraging existing corporate credentials
- Performance is crucial â€“ responses should be fast to maintain productivity
- Context retention is important for continuous assistance during development

### Security Team Perspective
- Complete audit trail of all interactions is non-negotiable
- Strict access controls based on job role/need
- Network isolation to prevent unauthorized data access
- Model access controls to limit capabilities as needed
- Compliance with regulatory requirements is mandatory

### DevOps Team Perspective
- Solution must be deployable via Infrastructure as Code
- Monitoring and alerting capabilities are essential
- Resource utilization and cost tracking features needed
- Clear documentation on operational aspects
- Ability to automate deployment pipelines
